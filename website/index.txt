Bankjob is a command line ruby program for scraping online banking sites and producing statements as local files in OFX ("Open Fincancial Exchange":http://www.ofx.net) or CSV (Comma Separated Values) formats.

Bankjob was created for people like me who want to get their bank data into a 3rd party application but whose bank does not support downloads in OFX format.
It's also useful for keeping a permanent store of bank statements on your computer for reading in Excel.

h2. Installing

Mac OSX / Linux:
<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install bankjob</pre>

Windows:
<pre syntax="ruby">gem install bankjob</pre>

h2. The basics

* Scrapes an online banking website to produce a bank statement
* Stores bank statements locally in CSV files, which can be loaded directly in spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel
* Stores bank statements locally in OFX files, which can be imported by many programs such as Quicken, MS Money, Gnu Cash and uploaded to some web applications
* Built-in support for uploading to your Wesabe account (www.wesabe.com)
* Supports coding of simple rules in ruby for modifying transaction details. E.g. automatically change "pment inst 3245003" to "paid home loan interest"

h2. Usage

<pre>
bankjob --csv c:\bank\csv --scraper c:\bank\my_bpi_scraper.rb
        --scraper-args "<my_username> <my_password>"
        --wesabe "<wesabe_user> <wesabe_pass> <wesabe_acct>
        --log c:\bank\bankjob.log --debug
</pre>

I have this command in a .bat file which is launched daily by a scheduled task on my windows Media Center PC (which, since it's always on and connected to the internet, makes a useful home server)

This one command will:
* scrape my online banking website after logging in as me and navigating to the page with recent transactions
* apply some rules, coded in the <code>my_bpi_scraper.rb</code> file that make the descriptions more readable
* produce a statement in comma-separated-value format, keeping the original raw data as well as the new descriptions,
  storing that in a file with a name like <code>20090327-20090406.csv</code> in my local directory <code>c:\bank\csv</code> (serves as a sort of permanent 'audit' record)
* produce an OFX document with the same statement information
* upload the OFX statement to my wesabe account
* log debug-level details in bankjob.log

h2. Creating your own Scraper

Unfortunately Bankjob isn't much good to you in its natural state unless you happen to bank with the same bank as me.
To make it useful you need a scraper for your own online bank site. How hard that will be depends on how handy you are with "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org programming and with using "Hpricot":http://wiki.github.com/why/hpricot/an-hpricot-showcase and "Mechanize":http://mechanize.rubyforge.org/mechanize

You'll get some help from:
* "The Mechanize docs":http://mechanize.rubyforge.org/mechanize
* "The Hpricot wiki":http://wiki.github.com/why/hpricot/an-hpricot-showcase
* The #BpiScraper# is included in the scrapers directory and is well documented as an example.
* The #BaseScraper# is the superclass of #BpiScraper#. Using it as a base class for your own scraper is optional, but it saves you a little work by starting up Mechanize for you.
* The Scraper class itself, which you _must_ subclass with your own Scraper, has more to say on creating your own scraper in its "rubydocs":http://bankjob.rubyforge.org/classes/lib/bankjob/Scraper
* Look for help on the "forum":http://groups.google.com/group/bankjob
* Ask me directly "rhubarb":mailto:rhubarb.bankjob@gmail.com

<em>Warning: Don't upload or email anyone (including me) your private online banking information. If you create your own scraper, please share it, but remove any account details from it first.</em>

If and when you do develop a scraper for your banksite, send it to me (without any passwords or private banking info of course!) and I'll add it to the built-in scrapers.
